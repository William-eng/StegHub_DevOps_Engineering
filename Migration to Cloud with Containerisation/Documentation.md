# Migration to the Ð¡loud with containerization (Docker & Docker Compose)1- 101

Until now, we have been using VMs (AWS EC2) in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (AWS VPC) to deploy your web solutions, and it works well in many cases. We have learned how easy to spin up and configure a new EC2 manually
or with such tools as Terraform and Ansible to automate provisioning and configuration. We have also deployed two different websites on the same VM; this approach is scalable, but to some extent; imagine what if we need 
to deploy many small applications (it can be web front-end, web-backend, processing jobs, monitoring, logging solutions, etc.) and some of the applications will require various OS and runtimes of different versions and
conflicting dependencies - in such case you would need to spin up serves for each group of applications with the exact OS/runtime/dependencies requirements. When it scales out to tens/hundreds and even thousands of 
applications (e.g., when we talk of microservice architecture), this approach becomes very tedious and challenging to maintain.

In this project, we will learn how to solve this problem and begin to practice the technology that revolutionized application distribution and deployment back in 2013! We are talking of Containers and imply _Docker_.
Even though there are other application containerization technologies, Docker is the standard and the default choice for shipping your app in a container!

## Install Docker and prepare for migration to the Cloud

First, we need to install _Docker Engine_, which is a client-server application that contains:

A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd.
APIs that specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
A command-line interface (CLI) client docker.

As we have already learned - unlike a VM, Docker allocated not the whole guest OS for your application, but only isolated minimal part of it - this isolated container has all that your application needs and at the same
time is lighter, faster, and can be shipped as a Docker image to multiple physical or virtual environments, as long as this environment can run Docker engine. This approach also solves the environment incompatibility 
issue. It is a well-known problem when a developer sends his application to you, you try to deploy it, deployment fails, and the developer replies, "- _It works on my machine!_". With Docker - if the application is 
shipped as a container, it has its own environment isolated from the rest of the world, and it will always work the same way on any server that has Docker engine.

## MySQL in container
Let us start assembling our application from the Database layer - we will use a pre-built MySQL database container, configure it, and make sure it is ready to receive requests from our PHP application.

## Step 1: Pull MySQL Docker Image from Docker Hub Registry

Start by pulling the appropriate **Docker image for MySQL.** You can download a specific version or opt for the latest release, as seen in the following command:

    docker pull mysql/mysql-server:latest

- ![docker-mysql](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e43a1494-ef80-4e91-8b97-49a242c4104c)
    

If you are interested in a particular version of MySQL, replace latest with the version number. Visit Docker Hub to check other tags [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mysql/mysql-cluster/tags)

List the images to check that you have downloaded them successfully:

        docker image ls
- ![dockerls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd57e561-e757-40c2-a3b3-0130d1b8e349)

  
## Step 2: Deploy the MySQL Container to your Docker Engine

1. Once you have the image, move on to deploying a new MySQL container with:

        docker run --name <container_name> -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<my-secret-pw> -d mysql/mysql-server:latest

- Replace _<container_name>_ with the name of your choice. If you do not provide a name, Docker will generate a random one
- The -d option instructs Docker to run the container as a service in the background
- Replace _<my-secret-pw>_ with your chosen password
- In the command above, we used the latest version tag. This tag may differ according to the image you downloaded

2. Then, check to see if the MySQL container is running: Assuming the container name specified is mysql-server

         docker ps -a

- ![runniingContainer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/407bd48e-3aff-40e2-b9c7-f68bc71b20c1)
You should see the newly created container listed in the output. It includes container details, one being the status of this virtual environment. The status changes from health: starting to healthy, once the setup
 is complete.

## Step 3: Connecting to the MySQL Docker Container
We can either connect directly to the container running the MySQL server or use a second container as a MySQL client. Let us see what the first option looks like.

**Approach 1**

Connecting directly to the container running the MySQL server:

      docker exec -it <container_name> mysql -uroot -p
- ![condocksql](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/370d151f-5e15-4209-adfc-157f817062a4)

      

Provide the root password when prompted. With that, you have connected the MySQL client to the server.

Finally, change the server root password to protect your database.

- ![passworddockchange](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/125e6a09-bbb9-4117-b629-802454d0d52d)

**Approach 2**

First, create a network:

        docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/24 tooling_app_network 

Creating a custom network is not necessary because even if we do not create a network, Docker will use the default network for all the containers you run. By default, the network we created above is of _DRIVER Bridge_. So, also, it is the default network. You can verify this by running the _docker network ls_ command.

But there are use cases where this is necessary. For example, if there is a requirement to control the _cidr_ range of the containers running the entire application stack. This will be an ideal situation to create a network and specify the _--subnet_

For clarity's sake, we will create a network with a subnet dedicated for our project and use it for both MySQL and the application so that they can connect.

Run the MySQL Server container using the created network.

First, let us create an environment variable to store the root password:

      export MYSQL_PW=<root-secret-password>

Then, pull the image and run the container, all in one command like below:

    docker run --network tooling_app_network -h mysqlserverhost --name=mysql-server -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$MYSQL_PW  -d mysql/mysql-server:latest 


Flags used

- -d runs the container in detached mode
- --network connects a container to a network
- -h specifies a hostname

If the image is not found locally, it will be downloaded from the registry.

Verify the container is running:

        docker ps -a


As you already know, it is best practice not to connect to the MySQL server remotely using the root user. Therefore, we will create an SQL script that will create a user we can use to connect remotely.

Create a file and name it _create_user.sql_ and add the below code in the file:

      CREATE USER '<user>'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<client-secret-password>';
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO '<user>'@'%';

Run the script:

      docker exec -i mysql-server mysql -uroot -p$MYSQL_PW < ./create_user.sql
If you see a warning like below, it is acceptable to ignore:

    mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

## Connecting to the MySQL server from a second container running the MySQL client utility
The good thing about this approach is that you do not have to install any client tool on your laptop, and you do not need to connect directly to the container running the MySQL server.

Run the MySQL Client Container:

        docker run --network tooling_app_network --name mysql-client -it --rm mysql mysql -h mysqlserverhost -u <user-created-from-the-SQL-script> -p

Flags used:

- --name gives the container a name
- -it runs in interactive mode and Allocate a pseudo-TTY
- --rm automatically removes the container when it exits
- --network connects a container to a network
- -h a MySQL flag specifying the MySQL server Container hostname
- -u user created from the SQL script
- -p password specified for the user created from the SQL script

## Prepare database schema
Now you need to prepare a database schema so that the Tooling application can connect to it.

1. Clone the Tooling-app repository from [here](https://github.com/StegTechHub/tooling-02.git)

         git clone https://github.com/StegTechHub/tooling-02.git

2. On your terminal, export the location of the SQL file
   
        export tooling_db_schema=<path-to-tooling-schema-tile>/tooling_db_schema.sql

3. Use the SQL script to create the database and prepare the schema. With the docker exec command, you can execute a command in a running container.

        docker exec -i mysql-server mysql -uroot -p$MYSQL_PW < $tooling_db_schema

- ![setup1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fce0f8b8-d7b1-444e-8d89-eeef930e734c)

4. Update the db_conn.php file with connection details to the database

        $servername = "mysqlserverhost";
        $username = "<user>";
        $password = "<client-secret-password>";
        $dbname = "toolingdb";

- ![db_php](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e2783d4-3b2a-4509-96da-87e744e37d61)

- Create a .env file in tooling-02/html/.env with connection details to the database.

        MYSQL_IP=mysqlserverhost
        MYSQL_USER=<username>
        MYSQL_PASS=<client-secrete-password>
        MYSQL_DBNAME=toolingdb

- ![Screenshot from 2024-11-08 21-30-13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42bb00c0-dc52-4464-80e1-973e448e3b22)

Flags used:

- MYSQL_IP: mysql ip address "leave as mysqlserverhost"
- MYSQL_USER: mysql username for user exported as environment variable
- MYSQL_PASS: mysql password for the user exported as environment varaible
- MYSQL_DBNAME: mysql databse name "toolingdb"


5. Run the Tooling App
_Containerization_ of an application starts with creation of a file with a special name - _Dockerfile_ (without any extensions). This can be considered as a 'recipe' or 'instruction' that tells Docker how to pack your application into a container. In this project, we will build our container from a pre-created _Dockerfile_, but as a _DevOps_, we must also be able to write _Dockerfiles_.

You can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnxI-K10auY) to get an idea how to create your Dockerfile and build a container from it.

And on this [page](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/), you can find official Docker best practices for writing Dockerfiles.

So, let us _containerize_ our _Tooling application_; here is the plan:

- Make sure you have checked out your Tooling repo to your machine with Docker engine
- First, we need to build the Docker image the tooling app will use. The Tooling repo you cloned above has a Dockerfile for this purpose. Explore it and make sure you understand the code inside it.
- Run _docker build_ command
- Launch the container with _docker run_
- Try to access your application via port exposed from a container
  
**Let us begin**:

Ensure you are inside the folder that has the Dockerfile and build your container:

        docker build -t tooling:0.0.1 .

In the above command, we specify a parameter -t, so that the image can be tagged tooling"0.0.1 - Also, you have to notice the . at the end. This is important as that tells Docker to locate the _Dockerfile_ in the current directory you are running the command. Otherwise, you would need to specify the absolute path to the _Dockerfile_.
- ![dockerbuild01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7149f86-6e9d-4649-b9c1-b8299d34e714)

- ![dockerbulid02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8e728e2-9b26-4a06-ae78-492db76e88d1)

6. Run the container:

        docker run --network tooling_app_network -p 8085:80 -it tooling:0.0.1
Let us observe those flags in the command.

We need to specify the --network flag so that both the Tooling app and the database can easily connect on the same virtual network we created earlier.
The -p flag is used to map the container port with the host port. Within the container, apache is the webserver running and, by default, it listens on port 80. You can confirm this with the CMD ["start-apache"] section of the Dockerfile. But we cannot directly use port 80 on our host machine because it is already in use. The workaround is to use another port that is not used by the host machine. In our case, port 8085 is free, so we can map that to port 80 running in the container.
