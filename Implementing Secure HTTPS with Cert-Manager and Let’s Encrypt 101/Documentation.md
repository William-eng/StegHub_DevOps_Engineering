# Implementing Secure HTTPS with Cert-Manager and Letâ€™s Encrypt 101
In this project, we'll enhance the security of our Artifactory deployment by implementing HTTPS using [Cert-Manager](https://cert-manager.io) to request and manage TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt automatically. 
Cert-manager creates TLS certificates for workloads in your Kubernetes cluster and renews the certificates before they expire. This will provide a trusted HTTPS URL for our application.

**Prerequisites**:

- EKS Kubernetes cluster with Nginx Ingress Controller installed
- Helm 3.x installed
- Kubectl configured to interact with your cluster
- Domain name configured with DNS pointing to your Ingress Controller's load balancer
- Nginx Ingress Controller installed (from the previous project)
