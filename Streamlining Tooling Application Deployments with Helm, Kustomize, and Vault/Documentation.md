This project provides a practical guide to deploying and managing a "tooling application" (replace with your specific application context) in Kubernetes using a robust combination of Helm, Kustomize, and Vault.

Kubernetes, so Helm should not always be your default choice. It is important to be aware of the options available, know the pros and cons, and choose what works for your team or project.
Before we make a final decision on how we will realistically manage deployments into Kubernetes, let's see how Kustomize works.
