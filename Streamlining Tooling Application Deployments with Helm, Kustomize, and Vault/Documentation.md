# Streamlining Tooling Application Deployments with Helm, Kustomize, and Vault 102
This project provides a practical guide to deploying and managing a "tooling application" (replace with your specific application context) in Kubernetes using a robust combination of Helm, Kustomize, and Vault.
Based on our experience on previous projects, you should already have a grasp of experience using Helm, but you should also know that there are multiple choices available when it comes to deploying applications into
Kubernetes, so Helm should not always be your default choice. It is important to be aware of the options available, know the pros and cons, and choose what works for your team or project.
Before we make a final decision on how we will realistically manage deployments into Kubernetes, let's see how Kustomize works.

# How Kustomize Works
**Kustomize** uses a file called _kustomization.yaml_ that contains declarative specifications as to what resources need to be imported from what manifest files and what changes need to be made. Once it has processed the
resources, it emits them to the standard output, which can be stored in a file or directly used with _kubectl_ to apply it to a particular cluster.

One of the excellent use cases of Kustomize is to manage Kubernetes resources for multiple environments. For Kustomize to work in that scenario, you would need a base directory that would contain all manifest files with all 
the common elements and an overlays directory that contains all the differences for a particular environment.

To understand better, let’s look at a hands-on example.

# Installing Kustomize
Kustomize comes pre-bundled with kubectl version >= 1.14. You can check your version using _kubectl version_. If the kubectl version is 1.14 or greater there's no need to take any steps.

For a stand-alone Kustomize installation (aka Kustomize CLI), go through the official documentation to install [Kustomize - Here](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/)

# Working with Kustomize
Kustomize is a command line tool supporting template-free, structured customization of declarative configuration targeted to k8s-style objects.

Targeted to k8s means that _kustomize_ has some understanding of API resources, k8s concepts like names, labels, namespaces, etc., and the semantics of resource patching.

Kustomize is an implementation of [Declarative Application Management (DAM)](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/glossary/#declarative-application-management). A set of best practices around managing k8s clusters.
It is a configuration management solution that leverages layering to preserve the base settings of your applications and components by overlaying declarative YAML artifacts (called patches) that selectively override default settings without actually changing the original files (base files).

Kustomize relies on the following system of configuration management layering to achieve reusability:

- Base Layer - Specifies the most common resources
- Patch Layers - Specifies use of case-specific resources

Let’s step through how Kustomize works using a deployment scenario involving 3 different environments: **dev**, **sit**, and **prod**. In this example, we’ll use Service, Deployment, and Namespace resources. For the 
dev environment, there won't be any specific changes as it will use the same configuration from the base setting. In sit and prod environments, the replica settings will be different.
