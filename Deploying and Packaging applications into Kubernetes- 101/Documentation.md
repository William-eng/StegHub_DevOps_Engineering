# DEPLOYING AND PACKAGING APPLICATIONS INTO KUBERNETES WITH HELM

In the previous project, you explored Helm as a powerful tool for deploying applications into Kubernetes and expanded your experience by installing additional tools beyond Jenkins.

In this project, you will intensively deploy a variety of DevOps tools and tackle real-world challenges that come with such deployments. You will actively learn how to adjust Helm values files to automate the 
configuration of the applications you deploy. Once you have successfully set up the majority of the DevOps tools, you will leverage them to gain a comprehensive understanding of the DevOps cycle and how they seamlessly
integrate into the overall ecosystem.

Our focus will be on the following tools:

- Artifactory
- Hashicorp Vault
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Elasticsearch ELK using [ECK](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-install-helm.html)


Lets start first with Artifactory. What is it exactly?

Artifactory is part of a suit of products from a company called [Jfrog](https://jfrog.com/). Jfrog started out as an artifact repository where software binaries in different formats are stored. Today, Jfrog has 
transitioned from an artifact repository to a DevOps Platform that includes CI and CD capabilities. This has been achieved by offering more products in which **Jfrog Artifactory** is part of. Other offerings include

JFrog Pipelines – a CI-CD product that works well with its Artifactory repository. Think of this product as an alternative to Jenkins.
JFrog Xray – a security product that can be built-into various steps within a JFrog pipeline. Its job is to scan for security vulnerabilities in the stored artifacts. It is able to scan all dependent code.
In this project, the requirement is to use Jfrog Artifactory as a private registry for the organisation’s Docker images and Helm charts. This requirement will satisfy part of the company’s corporate security policies
to never download artifacts directly from the public into production systems. We will eventually have a CI pipeline that initially pulls public docker images and helm charts from the internet, store in artifactory and
scan the artifacts for security vulnerabilities before deploying into the corporate infrastructure. Any found vulnerabilities will immediately trigger an action to quarantine such artifacts.

Lets get into action and see how all of these work.

Deploy Jfrog Artifactory into Kubernetes
The best approach to easily get Artifactory into kubernetes is to use helm.
